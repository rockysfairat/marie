      "Marie created an interior design project for our Ukrainian bistro in Prague. We appreaciate Marie's taste and expertise. The project was completed both on time and within budget which was very important for us. The design itself skillfully blends modern aesthetics with traditional Ukrainian elements, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that combines coziness with contemporary style.",

      "Throughout 2021-2022, my husband and I had the pleasure of working with Marie on the interior design of our first home. Right from the start, Marie showed an incredible ability to listen; she didn’t just hear our requests, she understood them and brought them to life, creating spaces that resonated with our personalities and lifestyle.",

      "Recommendations for those of you who like to create an interior, but sometimes you could use some advice or you've found yourself in a situation you can’t solve. We planned to design the children's room, renovate  the bedroom and the bathroom. So I met with Marie and got a great material - “The Happy place guide”. So I learned that not everything I like is practical for us. We are also clear now about colors and materials. And we know how to optimize spending as well.",
