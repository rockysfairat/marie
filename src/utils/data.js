      "Recommendations for those of you who like to create an interior, but sometimes you could use some advice or you've found yourself in a situation you can’t solve. We planned to design the children's room, renovate  the bedroom and the bathroom. So I met with Marie and got a great material - “The Happy place guide”. So I learned that not everything I like is practical for us. We are also clear now about colors and materials. And we know how to optimize spending as well.",
